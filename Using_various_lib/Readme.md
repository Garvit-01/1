## GENDER_CLASSIFICATION

This is the code for the gender classification. The code uses the scikit-learn machine learning library to train a decision tree on a small dataset of body metrics (height, width, and shoe size) labeled male or female. Then we can predict the gender of someone given a novel set of body metrics.
